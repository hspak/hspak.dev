<p>I’ve finally finished this website. I thought I’d to a walkthrough for future
reference.</p>
<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>I’m currently self-hosting this website through the following stack:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://beagleboard.org/BLACK">BeagleBone Black</a></li>
<li><a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/">Arch ARM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.nginx.com/">Nginx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I actually bought the BeagleBone Black for self-hosting. It’s something I’ve
always wanted to experiment with and I had to jump on it with its low cost. I
chose Arch ARM because I’m already a fan of Arch Linux. Installation was
extremely short and honestly, it’s probably more user-friendly with it’s own
cherry-picked AUR repo. Nginx is just awesome.</p>
<p>The actual website is built using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a></li>
<li><a href="https://highlightjs.org/">Hightlight.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fontawesome.io/">Font Awesome</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Jekyll seemed like a wise choice because its by Github and Github is awesome. I
also didn’t know of any other easy to setup blogging platform other than
Wordpress. I know Jekyll does have a built in code syntax highlighting (of
sorts), but it requires Python and I didn’t want another dependency so I went
with highlight.js.</p>
<p><code>console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;); // an example</code></p>
<p>I came across Font Awesome for social media icons and it’s defintely an
overkill, but maybe I can find more uses for it other than the three icons I
have on the top right.</p>
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>Half the time contructing this website was spent trying to figure out how to
make it less…bland. The best method I found was to just look for other blogs
that already looked pretty and copy their ideas. So I added in a big black bar
hoping to achieve the parallax effect like Github’s
<a href="https://github.com/404">404</a> page, but more subtle. I found the jQuery
<a href="https://github.com/cameronmcefee/plax">plugin</a> that they use and tried
inplementing it, only to fail miserably. I decided that I should try to
understand what it is actually doing later instead of just doing a copy pasta
from the example. To replace it, I cropped an image from a random wallpaper and
stuck it in. I faded it away in shadow to fit my greyscale-ish theme and made it
focus on hover…becuase it was boring.</p>
<p>Definitely expect design overhauls in the future.</p>
<h2>Now What?</h2>
<p>This blog will be moved over to Github Pages and the domain as well. It’s
actually already being mirrored
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161004203141/http://hspak.github.io/">here</a>. I’m
just keeping it on my BeagleBone so I can get used to setting up Nginx and other
server configurations for my next project. I haven’t quite decided what kind of
content I would like to keep here.</p>
<p>Being a static blog site, there’s not much use for javascript. One of my
intentions for this website was to teach myself some javascript on the way, but
there wasn’t anything useful I could think of that would be easy to implement.
So as my next project, I’m thinking about a web app in
<a href="https://www.nodejs.org">Node.js</a> as my next project, hopefully successfully
hosted on my BeagleBone. It will most likely be a simple chat platform since
that’s what Ryan Dahl seemed to usually do in his talks so I think it’s a good
place to start.</p>
