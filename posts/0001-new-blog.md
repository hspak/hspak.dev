Hello world!

This will now be my third blog re-write and each have only ever had a single
post... The main motivation here was to write a static blog generator in
[Zig](https://ziglang.org/), mostly for learning purposes.

This was mostly blocked on me writing a markdown parser so I can make it a
somewhat tolerable for writing blog posts. Recently I found out there's already
a [popular markdown parser for Zig](https://github.com/kivikakk/koino)!

Now that this is finally shipped, hopefully more posts will follow!
